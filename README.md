# Cursor Find and Track

This is a minimal Windows utility that helps you locate your mouse cursor—especially handy when working with multiple monitors.

> **Note:**  
> Windows already has a built-in way to locate your mouse (such as “Show location of pointer when I press the CTRL key” in Mouse Settings).  
> For most users, that’s more than enough.

## Why use this?

If you use several monitors and sometimes lose track of your mouse pointer.
