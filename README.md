# Cursor Find and Track

This is a minimal Windows utility that helps you locate your mouse cursor—especially handy when working with multiple monitors.

> **Note:**  
> Windows already has a built-in way to locate your mouse (such as “Show location of pointer when pressing the CTRL key” in Mouse Properties).  
> I recenntly found PowerToys, check out [Microsoft PowerToys – Mouse Utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/powertoys/mouse-utilities) or [PowerToys on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys).
